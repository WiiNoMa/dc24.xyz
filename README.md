# dc24 website
Yay :) It's here! The website for Disconnect24!
https://dc24.xyz

Check out [material-jekyll-theme](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/material-jekyll-theme) for the base theme.

If you want to work on the website, here is how to set it up (ensure you have git installed!):
```
git clone https://github.com/Disconnect24/dc24.xyz.git
cd disconnect24.xyz
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config.dev.yml
```
